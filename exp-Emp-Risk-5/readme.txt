A more extensive test for experiment 1.
Use new stochastic root finding, also separate Gen2 vs Gen5 data.
[Feb-23-2022] Compared to #3, this expt uses a smaller delta in the root finding function and a sanity check
[March-3-2022] Compared to #4 this uses a 50 step increments to find the N_margin. The initial results from the root finding code is
               used as an approximation.
